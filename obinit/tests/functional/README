This test suite runs bats to execute obinit binary and make the assertions.

NOTICE 1: Since obinit uses mount the tests have to be run as root. Consiter using virtual machine.
NOTICE 2: Systemd marks all the mount points as shared at boot time, hence moving rootmnt will not work. Use proper VM or call 'mount --mark-private /' if you know what you are doing.

TIP: IDE can run these tests via simple script containing 'sudo -E -S bats . < ./secret.tmp' and the 'secret.tmp' file.
